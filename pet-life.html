    <h1>A Sneak Peak Into <strong>The World of Pets</strong></h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Being a pet is certainly not a walk in the park neither is it a hell,far from it. It is just life like that of the human being with its own ups and downs.
    Would I as a pet want to opt out? Well, you can judge for yourself!</p>
    <h3>The worst part about being a pet is:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Having to be caddled even when I am not in the mood</li>
      <li>Living at the mercies of humans</li>
      <li>Most caregivers don't understand my language,they just assume they do but they don't</li>
      <li>Arranged marriages</li>
      <li>Forced to be family with those who are not my kind,while my real family(children) is snatched from me</li>
    </ul>
